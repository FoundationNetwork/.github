Foundation is a tool created to enable the seamless exchange of tokenized values in an ecosystem-agnostic fashion, addressing the limitations of decentralized trading caused by the fragmenting nature of blockchains, which result in dispersed liquidity and a suboptimal user experience.

Featuring a hybrid orderbook/omni-chain aggregation core and setting our performance bar at par with industry leaders, Foundation allows users to seamlessly trade predefined values across ecosystems, and settle trades on any blockchain where Foundation is deployed.
